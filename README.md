You can still fire with the shield, but upon deploying your weapon defaults to pistol. It's the only weapon you can fire with your free hand!
You can only switch weapons when your shield is lowered, you've only got two hands, right?

Oncoming damage is indicated by a klaxon;
Do not be alarmed by the running Tomer in the first screen. He can be removed in the level.ts file.
At the mo, the second menu button only links to files on my computer.
Music is on, by default.

Note...
the spin-up on the chaingun, it was hard to do.
the animation frames on the duke machinegun(6). It's better than the original, trust me.
the changing ammo icons.
the ricochets off raised shield.

Current bugs:
Scene shifts are bit glitchy.
Machine guns can get stuck on strafe mode.
Ammo sometimes reaches -1.
Creatures can get stuck on hurt frame.
Chainsaw can still kill things far away, needs real size-checker.
